#GolfTracker

Welcome to GolfTracker, a web application for my rails project through flatiron that allows users to sign up or log in with an enabled third party authentication system in order to create and update their own collection of golf courses.

#Installation

You will need to install the necessary gems to run the application. Please clone this repository and run the following lines in your terminal:

$ bundle install $ rails db:migrate

#Usage

In order to start using the application, enter the following line in your terminal:

$ rails s

Next, open the server link in your browser (I recommend using Chrome) and enjoy using the application!
